            <h3>Treatment and retreatment trends</h3>
            <p> Australia has made world-leading strides towards HCV elimination. By 2024, 105,947 people had initiated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) 
                treatments in Australia - half of the estimated population with HCV relative to 2015. Both the prescribers treating HCV and population 
                being treated have changed over time. Treatment initiation decreased over time while retreatment initiation has increased. By the end 
                of 2023, 10% (n=10567) of the treated population had been retreated at least once (range 1-8 times).</p>

            <h3>Reinfection and treatment failure</h3>
            <p> Of retreatments (n=13,465), 59% were for reinfection and 41% were for treatment failure. An increasing trend in retreatment for 
                reinfection was observed, with distinct acceleration in 2022-2023 (following COVID-19 restrictions). Retreatment for treatment failure 
                did not mimic the decreasing treatment initiation trend. Retreatment for treatment failure peaked in 2019, when a new salvage DAA 
                (for resistant virus) became available, then stabilised from 2021. </p>

            <h3>Retreatment for reinfection in prisons </h3>
            <p> HCV treatment in prisons increased over time. By the end of 2023 40% of all treatment delivery occurred in custodial settings.
                The increase in prison treatments correlated with an increase in retreatment for reinfection in prisons. 
                An estimated two-thirds (63%) retreatment for reinefction occured in prison. </p>

        <h3>Treatment discontinuation and retreatment</h3>
        <p> Half (55%) of those retreated for treatment failure discontinued initial treatment (missed â‰¥28-days of an 8-24 week regimen). 
            The stabilisation of the retreatment for treatment failure trend from 2020 correlated with an increasing national trend of 
            treatment discontinuation. Discontinuation rates were higher for younger people and those treated by low-caseload GP prescribers.</p>
